## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

- **To bold text**, use `**To bold text**`.
- *To italicize text*, use `*To italicize text*`.
- Abbreviations, like HTML should be defined like this `*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language`.
- Citations, like <cite>&mdash; Mark otto</cite>, should use `<cite>`.
- ~~Deleted~~ text should use `~~deleted~~` and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use `<ins>`.
- Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses `<sup>` and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses `<sub>`.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
